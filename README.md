# Caisse

A Java desktop app i made for a friend, whichb he'll use for his shop.
It serves as a rudimentary shop checkout, and lets you print tickets.
Since it was a quick quick thing, it is specifically formatted to print on the POS-58 Bluetooth printer.
I'm pretty proud of it, and i'm thinking of making a bigger and better version someday.
